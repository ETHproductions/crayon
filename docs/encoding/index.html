### Encoding

Crayon uses a custom encoding called CraSCII for the first half of the code table, which contains custom positional and directional chars in the range 00-1F:

    Hex Name  Char  Task (r-down means down relative to the cursor, i.e. at a 90 degree angle.)
    00  rst   •     Reset all directional and positional changes made to the cursor.
    01  de    →     Point the cursor east (to the right).
    02  dse   ↘     Point the cursor south-east.
    03  ds    ↓     Point the cursor south.
    04  dsw   ↙     Point the cursor south-west.
    05  dw    ←     Point the cursor west.
    06  dnw   ↖     Point the cursor north-west.
    07  dn    ↑     Point the cursor north.
    08  dne   ↗     Point the cursor north-east.
    09  anc   ⚓     This is the "anchor" (or "origin") of a pattern when drawn onto the canvas.
                    If not specified, the default is 0,0 (the top left corner).
    0A  nl    ↵     Move r-down one line, with respect to the direction of the cursor, and to the beginning of the line.
    0B  tab   ↦     Move the cursor forward to the nearest tab marker. This is, by default, every 4th char.
    0C  vtb   ↧     Move the cursor r-down to the nearest vertical tab marker. Almost the same as tab.
    0D  cr    ↤     Move the cursor back to the beginning of the line.
    0E  rnl   ↰     Same as nl, but move r-up instead of r-down.
    0F  xnl   ↩     Reset the cursor completely and move to the beginning of the next line.
    10  sd    ➥     Slide the cursor r-down by one row.
    11  su    ➦     Slide the cursor r-up by one row.
    12  tr1   ⤸     Turn the cursor clockwise by 45 degrees.
    13  tr2   ⤵     Turn the cursor clockwise by 90 degrees.
    14  tr3   ↷     Turn the cursor clockwise by 135 degrees.
    15  tu4   ⟲     Turn the cursor around (by 180 degrees).
    16  tl3   ↶     Turn the cursor counter-clockwise by 135 degrees.
    17  tl2   ⤷     Turn the cursor counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
    18  tl1   ⤹     Turn the cursor counter-clockwise by 45 degrees.
    1F  nbsp  ¶     When the pattern is drawn onto the canvas, overwrite the character underneath with a space.
    20  sp          When the pattern is drawn onto the canvas, leave the character underneath untouched.

The rest of the encoding may abide with ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc., but for the most part, only chars in the range 00-7E are used.
